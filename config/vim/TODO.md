# TODO

*   replace buffer

*   WRITE GENERALIZED FZF PLUGIN

*   plugin idea:
    *   associate each window with a set of buffers
    *   statusline of each window shows these buffers
    *   cycle through buffers window-wise
    *   operate on buffers in groups of windows

*   roll own bufferline:
    *   fg color based
    *   all flags (both buffer and file)
*   minify tabline
*   where full file name?

*   Helptags (see pathogen)

*   roll own file browser?
*   dirvish shell integration
*   dirvish 'invalid or access denied' after cd (report upstream)

*   youcompleteme without python in path
*   more buffers (movement between buffers)
*   tab bar = buffers?
*   fzf tags
*   automatch parens, fun/endfun, etc.

*   find mapping worthy of <backspace>
*   tabular comment function
    *   will improve regex to only match last comment phrase in line
    *   and not match full-line comments
