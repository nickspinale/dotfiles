dotfiles
========

My personal configuration files for various tools and systems.

#### Contents

*   **`src/`**: All of my configuration files for everything
*   **`scripts/`**: Files and scripts for traditional dotfile-type configurations
    *   `setup.sh`: Does exactly what you'd expect with a stdin stream of *`relative/path/of/target/from/src`* *`/absolute/path/of/link/name`* pairs. Files of such pairs can be found in `scripts/` as well.
*   **`notes/`**: Files that aren't for computers
*   **`store/`**: Bits of files that will someday be useful

#### Notes

*   A repository called `vim-runtime` is the subset of the runtime files that ship with vim that I use.
*   A repository of submodules called `vim-bundle` defines the set of github-based plugins I use.
