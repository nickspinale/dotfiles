dotfiles
========

My personal configuration files for various tools and systems.

#### Contents

*   **`config/`**: All of my configuration files for everything, with a few vim-related exceptions (see `src/editors/vim` for more info)
*   **`bin/`**: Scripts for my path
*   **`boilerplate/`**: Files for copying
*   **`notes/`**: Files that aren't for computers
*   **`setup/`**: Files and scripts for traditional dotfile-type configurations
    *   `setup.sh`: Does exactly what you'd expect with a stdin stream of *`relative/path/of/target/from/src`* *`/absolute/path/of/link/name`* pairs. Files of such pairs can be found in `scripts/` as well.
